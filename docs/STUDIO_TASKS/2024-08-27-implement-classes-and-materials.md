Goal: Implement Phase 1 business logic for Classes and Materials.

Scope (IN):
- Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) logic for the `classes` module.
- Implement CRUD logic for the `materials` module.
- Add the ability to assign/remove students and teachers to/from a class.
- The UI should include basic list and detail pages for both modules.
- Create a "Preview" view for a material that is read-only.

Scope (OUT):
- Does not include student submissions or grading.
- Does not include advanced material editing tools.

Acceptance:
- A user can create a new class.
- A user can view a list of all classes and click to see a detail page.
- A user can create a new material.
- The application continues to build and run if either the `classes` or `materials` module is disabled.
- CODEMAP is updated with all new functions.
